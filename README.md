# Contexto

Really love Contexto! Super fun. (https://contexto.me/) It's fun that the words can be essentially anything, but for Arcade, I wanted to do one that only used CS-like terms. 

Development Progress:
 - Setup my Dash App
 - Some of the logic is in place, I added a hint feature as it's always really annoying to be 10 similarity away and have no idea.
 - 
Future Steps:
 - I integrated a bit of PyDictionary, my next step is to pull that in, use a similarity model, and then have my game logic run on that.
